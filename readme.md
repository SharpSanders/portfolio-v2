## Overview

Portfolio v2 is a curated, data-driven portfolio that dynamically renders featured projects from a structured JSON file. It is designed to be:

- Fast
- Minimal
- Easy to maintain
- Professional in presentation

The goal is to clearly communicate my frontend capability while building toward full-stack and AI specialization.

## Features

- Responsive layout (mobile-first)
- Dynamic project rendering from `projects.json`
- Search functionality
- Tag filtering
- Clean card-based UI
- Structured sections (Hero, Projects, Skills, Roadmap, Contact)
- GitHub Pages deployment

## Tech Stack

- HTML5
- Modern CSS (Flexbox, Grid, custom properties)
- Vanilla JavaScript (DOM manipulation, filtering logic)
- Git + GitHub Pages

## Architecture

Projects are stored in a separate `projects.json` file.  
This allows:

- Easy addition/removal of projects
- Clean separation of data and UI
- Scalable updates without editing markup repeatedly

The UI is rendered dynamically using JavaScript to improve maintainability.

## What This Project Demonstrates

- Clean UI structure and visual hierarchy
- DOM-driven rendering
- Filtering and search logic
- Scalable frontend architecture without frameworks
- Deployment workflow using GitHub Pages

## Future Improvements

- Dark/light theme toggle
- Project detail modal view
- React-based version
- API-driven GitHub integration
- Performance optimization pass
